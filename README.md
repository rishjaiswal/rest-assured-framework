## TestNG
TestNG is a testing framework and it provides the full control over the test cases and the execution of the test cases.

## RestAssured
 Rest Assured is a group of java libraries which enables us to automate Rest API testing.

## ExtentReports
Extent Reports is a customisable HTML report using TestNG frameworks with stepwise and pie chart representation.
